			<p>Melyssa’s interest in fitness began in high school as a competitive cheerleader. She excelled in the sport and transitioned from team captain to head coach after graduating and began her quest to get into nursing school.</p>
			<blockquote>“After coaching for a year, my body started changing because I wasn’t participating in the sport anymore and stopped working out. I knew nothing but cheerleading. But I knew I had to change something.”</blockquote>
			<p>Melyssa began reading Oxygen magazine and started following the nutrition and exercise plans and saw great results.</p>
			<blockquote>“Nursing school was parallel to the new lifestyle I was living.”</blockquote>
			<p>When Melyssa began dating her now husband, he started teaching her how to weight lift. She realized she was capable of lifting much heavier weights and added more intense workouts into her routines even beginning CrossFit. CrossFit taught her how to train intensely, but something was missing. Soon, Melyssa realized the missing piece was knowledge regarding nutrition. CrossFit gave her the motivation to decide to compete as an NPC bikini bodybuilding competitor and she quickly placed in top 5 her first national show in Las Vegas at Muscle Contest's USA National Championships!</p>
			<p>Melyssa put competing on hold once being accepted to a nursing program. She has her sights set on working on the cardiac floor as a Nurse. Training on the cardiac floor gave her a passion to help people take care of themselves.</p>
			<blockquote>“I really enjoy being able to educate people about different lifestyle choices, why they’re sick, and how to feel better.”</blockquote>
			<p>Melyssa’s goal is to help train her clients so they will never have to be one of her patients.</p>
			<blockquote>“I want to reach out to people who are intimidated to enter a gym and teach them that the gym is a safe place and encourage them to incorporate healthier choices into their lifestyle. If more people become comfortable in the gym and realize the importance of fitness and nutrition, less people will see me in a hospital setting.”</blockquote>
			<p>Whether you are training for a marathon or new to working out and want to learn more about how to live a healthier lifestyle, Melyssa is here to ensure you meet your goals, safely and effectively.</p>
			<p>Melyssa’s Favorite Work Out Style: Combining functional training with isolation training techniques she learned from CrossFit, Olympic Weightlifting, and Bodybuilding.</p>
			<blockquote>“I love that combining these styles keeps my heart rate up while safely and effectively working on cardiovascular endurance, athleticism, and aesthetics. What more could you ask for?”</blockquote>
			<p>Favorite Post-Competition Meal: Burger with fries and a glass of red wine.</p>
			<p>Melyssa trains Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings, Tuesday and Thursday mornings, and Saturdays. To get on her schedule call <a href="tel:7573404800">340-4800</a>!</p>
