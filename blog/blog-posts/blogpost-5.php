			<h3>MENTAL PERFORMANCE FOR THRIVING UNDER PRESSURE (PART 1)</h3>
			<p>Each of us has the heart of a warrior. As warriors we embark on a journey to accomplish our dreams and achieve our true potential. Throughout this journey we encounter numerous obstacles and setbacks that will test our physical and mental strengths. However, the true journey is how we hurdle these obstacles, persevere, and learn from our mistakes. The field of Mental Performance (Sport Psychology) specializes in providing all warriors (athletes, musicians, doctors, executives, soldiers, etc.) with the necessary mental and cognitive skills needed to achieve and sustain optimal performance in high pressure scenarios.</p>
