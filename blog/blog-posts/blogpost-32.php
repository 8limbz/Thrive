			<h3>THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS DEFIED THE ODDS BY COMING BACK FROM A SITUATION THAT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE!</h3>
			<p>Tom Brady credited the team's Mental Toughness for their Epic Superbowl win.</p>
			<p>Mental toughness is a collection of mental performance skill sets that allow a person to persevere through difficult circumstances and emerge without losing confidence.</p>
			<p>The ability to focus the mind and view negatives as opportunities is a strategic mental performance skill that separates Tom Brady and the New England Patriots from their peers.</p>
			<h3>HERE ARE A FEW OF THE MENTAL PERFORMANCE TOOLS THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS USE TO DOMINATE THEIR COMPETITION:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Self-Regulation and Effective Thinking. They were able to optimize their mindset and remain focused even when they were down by 18. When things go wrong, they don't go with them.</li>
				<li>MANAGING MISTAKES AND REBOUNDING FROM FAILURE BY USING THE 3 R'S: RECOGNIZE, RESET, AND REFOCUS. BEING A WINNER REQUIRES NOTICING ATTENTION THIEVES, COMING BACK TO THE BREATH, AND REFOCUSING ON WHAT IS IMPORTANT NOW.</li>
				<li>Down Regulation and Recovery. In the face of an intense lifestyle of trainings, publicity, travel, and high pressure games, Tom Brady expertly optimizes game performances with Strategic Rest and Recovery periods which are crucial for focus.  His Recovery tools include Mindfulness Meditation techniques because of their effectiveness at slowing down the mind and down regulating the body.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Mental Toughness is a skill that you can learn to apply during under high pressure situations.</p>
			<h3>COGNITIVE AND MENTAL SKILLS TRAINING PROVES TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO BE INVALUABLE INVESTMENTS NEEDED BY TOP PERFORMERS.</h3>
			<p>It takes systematic cognitive training to seperate yourself from your competition and become a champion. </p>
