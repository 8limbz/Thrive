			<p>Later this year, Julie gets to start traveling the world to teach a new Postural Restoration Course called <a href="http://www.posturalrestoration.com/programs-courses/affiliate-courses/integration-for-fitness" target="_blank">PRI Integration for Fitness &amp; Movement</a>. It is an advanced lecture and lab course designed to assist personal trainers, fitness instructors, coaches, sports medicine professionals, and movement enthusiasts in restoring tri-planar function and core performance. Participants will gain an appreciation for PRI fundamental principles as applied to various fitness, performance, and rehabilitation settings. PRI based screening tools will be provided to guide exercise selection, technique cueing, and programming. Emphasis will be placed on biomechanical components of gait and thoracic position while additional emphasis is placed on neurological movement concepts like breathing, grounding and proprioceptive integration. Lab sessions will allow participants to experience each of the principles presented and learn how to immediately apply concepts in their setting. Programs will be designed to restore alternating reciprocal movement patterns to optimize athletic durability.</p>
			<p>This year Julie gets to travel to Philadelphia and San Fransisco. Next year she teaches in Chicago, Seattle, Dallas, Boston, and Phoenix. And in 2017 she gets to start traveling to teach internationally! <a href="http://www.posturalrestoration.com/pri-resources/featured-interview-viewer?article_id=92202" target="_blank">Click to read the interview!</a></p>
