			<p>A few weeks ago, I got to traveled to Phoenix to teach the <a href="https://www.posturalrestoration.com/programs-courses/affiliate-courses/integration-for-fitness" target="_blank">PRI Integration for Fitness and Movement course</a> for the 6th time.  Read the entire course review <a href="https://www.posturalrestoration.com/community/post/3403/pri-integration-for-fitness-and-movement-phoenix-az-course-in-review?id=3403" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
			<p>The course was hosted by the Sports Medicine Staff and Strength Coaches of the Arizona Diamondbacks. Amazing facility and staff. We had over 55 people in attendance, some were PTs, ATCs, Chiropractors, Strength Coaches, Personal Trainers, Yoga &amp; Pilates Instructors, and even a PE teacher.</p>

			<p>The course presents principles of Postural Restoration and Athletic Durability, so this quote in one of their training rooms couldn't have been more fitting!</p>

			<p>After the 2 day course, Sarah and I got to enjoy a day in beautiful Sedona, AZ! Great Trip and so grateful Sarah got to travel with me!</p>
