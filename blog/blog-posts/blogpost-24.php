			<p>"Chris, a 45-year-old business executive, had a family history of heart disease, and was feeling extremely stressed, fatigued, and generally in poor emotional health. A 24-hour heart rate variability analysis revealed abnormally depressed activity in both branches of his autonomic nervous system, suggesting autonomic exhaustion ensuing from maladaptation to high stress levels.</p>
			<p>His heart rate variability was far lower then would be expected for his age, and was below the clinical cut-off level for significantly increased risk of sudden cardiac death.</p>
			<p>In addition, Chrisâ€™s average heart rate was abnormally high at 102 beats per minute, and his heart rate did not drop at night as it should. Upon reviewing these results, his physician concluded that it was imperative that Chris take measures to reduce his stress."</p>
			<p>The Doctor recommended healthy alternative options to help Chris improve his psychophysiological coherence.
