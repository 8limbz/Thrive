			<p>When you first meet Angela, you immediately sense her warm energy. She radiates health and literally has a glow about her that makes you want to do whatever she is doing! This is why it came as a big surprise to learn that she wasn’t always this healthy and used to spend a lot of her time in and out of hospitals.</p>
			<p>Angela used to suffer from chronic health issues and stress. She didn’t realize that all of her health ailments were due to the amount of stress that she had in her life.</p>
			<blockquote>“The stress was creating anxiety – I didn’t even realize I was having anxiety attacks until I was sitting in front of my doctor when she told me I was in the middle of an anxiety attack.”</blockquote>
			<p>Her doctors continued to prescribe her antibiotics to deal with the sinus infections caused by allergies, which weakened her immune system and disrupted her entire system. Angela also suffered from migraines and had to see a pain management specialist to receive trigger point injections for the tension she carried in her shoulders.</p>
			<blockquote>“All of these appointments caused more stress due to time off from work.”</blockquote>
			<p>She found peace and healing in yoga. “Yoga really soothed me – and I knew that there was more to it than what meets the eye, and I wanted to learn more. I enrolled in a yoga teacher training program and knew this was what I needed to do.”</p>
			<p>Angela attended Yoga Teacher Training through Yax Yoga Concepts, which focused heavily on the mind and body connection and introduced her to holistic nutrition. This sparked her desire to explore Integrative Nutrition and she discovered the missing link to bettering herself. Angela gave up processed foods for whole, organic foods and traded synthetic medicine for DoTerra Natural Essential Oils and supplements.</p>
			<blockquote>“When I went non-toxic with food and started yoga with meditation I became a completely different person.”</blockquote>
			<p>She discovered that she did much better when she was able to be physical rather than sitting at a desk for over 8 hours a day. Angela resigned from her corporate finance job and became a full-time yoga teacher and integrative health coach.</p>
			<blockquote>“Once I made changes in my life – I realized I could help other people. When I aligned myself with my heart’s true desires and the path that I was supposed to be on, all of my health issues resolved naturally without medication.”</blockquote>
			<p>Angela started her own brand and website GlowWithAngela.com so that she could help others who can benefit from these gentle lifestyle changes. “My goal is to guide people to bring their mind and heart into alignment so that they can balance physically and spiritually.” She has 3 main steps that she will lead her clients through:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Detox -Guiding people to eat whole foods while eliminating preservatives and artificial chemicals will support the body in naturally healing itself. The first thing that I like to do with people is help them get off synthetic products, synthetic foods, synthetic OTC medications and possibly prescription medications with the integrative support of their prescribing doctor. This sets up the body to begin healing itself by reducing the burden overload on the filtering systems of the body.  Reducing toxins also brings more clarity and focus into their life to help with stress reduction. I help them with easy changes. Although gentle and easy, the changes are a wake-up call. Detoxifying helps not only physically, but also helps people be mindful of their thoughts, shifting from patterns from negativity to positivity and focusing on self-love.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Meditation – Building mind and body awareness with yoga, meditation, and breath work will reduce stress by getting the energy flowing in the body, helping them reconnect back to their center where they begin to remember. She works to help get people grounded and connected back into their bodies. This brings balance to the nervous system, therefore also balancing hormones, and restoring the body’s natural ability to heal itself. Additionally, meditation physically changes the brain structure, particularly the amygdala, which helps to reduce fear and stress in conditions such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Energy work – Scanning the body to notice which energy centers are out of balance to make a holistic plan and create the awareness needed to bring the client’s health back into alignment. Sessions will focus on the seven main energy centers in the body and how they correlate with our physical, emotional, and spiritual lives.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Angela Ioves working with women who would like to have more balance and natural health in their lifestyle. “My niche is women who struggle with stress, anxiety, focus, and self-love.” She also works with people who have minor health ailments, like migraines and digestive issues. “If they didn’t have these issues, it would change their lives.</p>
