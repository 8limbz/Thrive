			<p>Graston Technique® is a unique, evidence-based form of instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization that enables clinicians to effectively and efficiently address soft tissue lesions and fascial restrictions resulting in improved patient outcomes. Graston Technique®  uses specially-designed stainless steel instruments with unique treatment edges and angles to deliver an effective means of manual therapy.</p>
			<p>Sarah and Julie recently completed the Advanced Graston Technique® M2 Training! This progressive course incorporated the use of weights, resistance, sport positions and movements, along with new strokes and ways to use the Graston Technique® tools. The additional techniques learned offer more effective functional releases and transfer into sports movements.</p>
