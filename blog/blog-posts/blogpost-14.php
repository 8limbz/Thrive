			<p>The Mental Performance Specialists at Thrive help people develop the important skills necessary to be successful in sport and non-sport performance situations.</p>
			<h3>MENTAL AND COGNITIVE SKILLS TRAINING HELPS PEOPLE ACHIEVE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL, MANAGE STRESS, AND FUNCTION BETTER IN HIGH PRESSURE SCENARIOS.</h3>
			<p>Many people understand and recognize the importance of goal setting, concentration, and anxiety management. Unfortunately, its not always that easy to execute - especially when under pressure.  Vague suggestions like “be confident” or “relax” can cause frustration and even more anxiety if it's not understood how to regulate emotions or achieve those mental states.</p>
			<p>THRIVE utilizes cutting edge Biofeedback Thought Technology to facilitate self-awareness of performance inhibiting thoughts and behaviors, as well as, to learn strategies to optimally self-regulate the mind-body connection.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>An important job interview or crucial business meeting</li>
				<li>Maintaining a strategic focus during negotiations or sales</li>
				<li>Public speaking or giving a presentation in front of an intimidating crowd</li>
				<li>Testifying in court</li>
				<li>Test taking an important exam</li>
				<li>Performing a solo with a symphony orchestra</li>
