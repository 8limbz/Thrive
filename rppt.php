				<p>With advanced techniques, we aim to fix the mechanical failure that causes you to experience pain. Whether joint pain, excessive muscle tension, muscle pain, decreased or inefficient mobility, headaches, and any other symptom–we analyze and treat the body based on why the dysfunction is caused.</p>
				<p>Our bodies are mechanical in nature and with the right kind of care, they can become mechanically re-aligned, re-calibrated, and re-balanced.</p>
				<p>Unlike other forms of therapy, our team focuses on treating sport, orthopedic, and other injuries as part of a system, rather than as isolated injuries and symptoms. Our aim is to identify the root cause of your pain and balance the biomechanics of your body’s entire system.</p>
				<p>Our Movement Health experts consist of Sports + Spine specialists and Physical + Massage Specialists.</p>

							<h3>Graston Technique&reg;</h3>
							<p>Graston Technique&reg; is a unique, evidence-based form of instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization that enables clinicians to effectively and efficiently address soft tissue lesions and fascial restrictions resulting in improved patient outcomes. Graston Technique®  uses specially-designed stainless steel instruments with unique treatment edges and angles to deliver an effective means of manual therapy.</p>
							<h3>Why is soft tissue important?</h3>
							<p>The soft connective tissue (also called fascia), located just under the skin, is a white membrane that wraps and connects the muscles, bones, nerves, and blood vessels of the body. At times, the muscles or fascia are not stretched enough and they become stuck or tear, resulting in injury.</p>
							<p>Graston Technique&reg; is successful in effectively treating the soft tissue impairments associated with pain and various injuries, whether they are chronic, acute or post surgical.</p>
							<p>Our providers have completed the Advanced Graston Technique® M2 Training! This progressive course incorporated the use of weights, resistance, sport positions and movements, along with new strokes and ways to use the Graston Technique® tools. The additional techniques learned offer more effective functional releases and transfer into sports movements. The PT Team at THRIVE incorporates Graston Technique® with various other manual therapies and advanced therapy care to help you achieve fast pain relief, as well improve functional mobility so that you can quickly return to doing what you love without pain or restriction!</p>

							<h3>Dry Needling</h3>
							<p><a href="https://integrativedryneedling.com/resources/history-integrative-dry-needling/" target="_blank">Integrative</a> Dry Needling is based off the work of <a href="https://integrativedryneedling.com/resources/history-integrative-dry-needling/" target="_blank">Dr. Yun-tao Ma, PhD</a> and is an important modality in modern day Physical Therapy. This kind of treatment is powerful in treating soft tissue dysfunction, musculoskeletal pain, neuromuscular injury/imbalance and can accelerate the process of returning a patient's body to a state of homeostasis. <strong>Dry Needling should not be confused with acupuncture and a complete acupuncture treatment might yield a holistic benefit above and beyond our limited dry needling treatment.</strong></p>
							<p class="small">*The State of Virginia requires that dry needling be performed under the written referral and direction from a physician. If you would like dry needling incorporated into your treatment please be sure your doctor includes that in your referral for physical therapy.</p>

							<h3>Vacuum Cupping</h3>
							<p>Cupping dates back to 3000BC and is an ancient medical practice used by the Chinese, Hindu, and Egyptians. Vacuum cupping is a dry cupping that makes use of plastic, silicone, or glass cups with a vacuum seal to influence <a href="https://osteopractor.wordpress.com/2016/09/08/myofascial-cupping-therapy-for-pain-recovery-and-performance-current-evidence-and-proposed-mechanisms/" target="_blank">myofascial tissue physiology</a>. The cups use negative pressure to visibly lift the skin away from the body. Cupping is thought to improve microcirculation, nerve stimulation, and decrease areas of bodily pain and muscle tension (along with many other theoretical benefits). Cupping has been used for centuries among care practitioners, but it has come back in a new and more popular manner to help with chronic neck pain, low back pain, shoulder pain, problems with the knee, and to increase pressure-pain tolerance. It is also being used to enhance athletic performance for professional and Olympic athletes.</p>
