					<p>With advanced techniques, we aim to fix the mechanical failure that causes you to experience pain. Whether joint pain, excessive muscle tension, muscle pain, decreased or inefficient mobility, headaches, and any other symptom–we analyze and treat the body based on WHY the dysfunction is caused.</p>
					<p>Our bodies are mechanical in nature and with the right kind of care, they can become mechanically re-aligned, re-calibrated, and re-balanced.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<p>Unlike other forms of therapy, our team focuses on treating sport, orthopedic, and other injuries as part of a system, rather than as isolated injuries and symptoms. Our aim is to identify the root cause of your pain and balance the biomechanics of your body’s entire system.</p>
					<p>Our Movement Health experts consist of Sports &amp; Spine specialists and Physical &amp; Massage Specialists.</p>
