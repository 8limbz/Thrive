				<p>We do offer a self pay option. For many of our clients with high deductible insurance plans and steep co-pays, this is a much more affordable way to go. We have put into place innovative alternative therapy options for you, so you can receive quality care without breaking the bank.</p>
				<p>If you are looking to file through your insurance, please remember you are fully responsible for your copay, reaching your deductible, and any services not covered by your insurance.</p>
				<p>We are in network with some insurances and you can <a href="/contact_us.php">call or email</a> our office to learn more. Currently we are considered a Participating Provider for the following networks:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Anthem Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield</li>
					<li>Anthem HealthKeepers, Inc.</li>
					<li>United Health Care</li>
