					  <p>While swimming and rowing collegiately at Virginia Tech, Dr. Sanchez sought the expertise of a Sport Psychologist to help her through a performance slump. The positive impact this training had on her own athletic endeavors allowed her to realize her true passion - to assist others in achieving performance excellence while living a high quality, balanced life.</p>
					  <p>Dr. Sanchez's specialty is in providing cutting edge, research based interventions for mindfully performing under pressure, maintaining situation-awareness, and rebounding quickly from performance errors. She routinely integrates biofeedback technology for facilitating optimal psycho-physiological regulation of performance states. Mental skills training programs consist of group workshops and individual consultations focusing on rapid skill acquisition, performance enhancement, and performance recovery. Over the years she has had the opportunity to consult with junior elite and collegiate athletes, first responders, and military personnel.</p>
