				<h3>Aromatherapy and Essential Oils</h3>
				<p class="small">Aromatherapy, also referred to as Essential Oil therapy, can be defined as the art and science of using naturally extracted aromatic essences from plants to balance, harmonize and promote the health of body, mind and spirit. It seeks to unify physiological, psychological and spiritual processes to enhance an individual’s innate healing process – NAHA</p>

							<h3>Aromatherapy and Essential Oils</h3>
							<p>Aromatherapy is at least 6000 years old. The Egyptians used a method known as infusion to extract the oils from aromatic plants and incense; which was probably one of the earliest ways of using aromatics.</p>
							<p>The main difference between the ancient and modern aromatherapy, in the US, is that the scientific community has been drawn to understand and explain the power of aromatherapy as described by people through research and clinical trials. More and more of those exposed to genuine and authentic essential oils have reported such healing benefits that progress are slowly made to understand the chemistry and functions of aromatherapy on the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual human body. It is understood that everything in life vibrates, even our thoughts and feelings have vibratory qualities. The vibrations of the body easily go “out of tune” when physical or emotional stress is experienced. A blockage of energy flow will create disharmony and promote disease formation. Each plant carries its own unique vibration and frequency in harmony with nature. Essential oils possess that concentrated energy we can thrive on. We respond to both the frequency and the chemistry of an essential oil. Essential oils help the body, mind, spirit to activate their healing energy to reach a state of harmony and balance.</p>
							<p>Even though the area of research of electromagnetic energy and hypothetical subtle energy, or chi is in its infancy, some devices have been developed to measure the bio-frequency of humans and foods. A healthy human brain is currently measured to range between 71-90 MHz. A healthy human body ranges between 62-68 MHz. Diseases can lower the body frequency down to 42 MHz. Fresh produce and herbs are determined to range around 10-27 MHz. Essential oils have a frequency ranging from 52-580 MHz.</p>
							<p>Aromatherapy and Young Living™ essential oils offer our clientele an added form of natural healing while supporting all other therapies and promoting self-care, homecare and success to restore, revive, and optimize all body systems and performances.</p>
							<p>The certified clinical aromatherapy practitioner at Thrive offers integrative aromatherapy to support and maximize our client’s specific and individual wellness goals.</p>
